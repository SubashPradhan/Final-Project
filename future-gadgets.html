				<h1>FUTURE GADGETS WHAT'S NEXT ???</h1>
				<p class="para-3">
					It’s entertaining to make predictions about the technology that we’ll be using in the future, and many tech enthusiasts can’t help but speculate about topics like what kinds of apps we’ll be using in the future, or if we’ll still be using apps at all. But in many cases, those predictions are often wrong, and as Steve Lohr reports for The New York Times, “Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years.” Even though it’s pretty likely that current predictions will end up disproved, we’re still excited about what the next few years will bring in terms of technology. If you’re curious about the future, too, read on to learn about the seven gadgets that you’ll likely be able to get your hands on by the year 2020.

				<p class="para-3">
					There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A train may consist of a combination of one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a railcar). The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by steam locomotives. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, while at about the same time self-propelled multiple unit vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service.
					Hate commuting? Imagine, instead, your train carriage hurtling down a tunnel at the same speed as a commercial jet airliner. That’s the dream of PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. His Hyperloop system would see ‘train’ passengers travel at up to 760mph through a vacuum tube, propelled by compressed air and induction motors. A site has been chosen with the goal of starting test runs in two years. Once built, the loop will ferry passengers between San Francisco and LA in 35 minutes, compared to 7.5 hours by train.

				<p class="para-3">
					A camera is an optical instrument for recording or capturing images, which may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both. The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images constituting videos or movies. The camera is a remote sensing device as it senses subjects without physical contact. The word camera comes from camera obscura, which means "dark chamber" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye.
					More hybrids and all different. All are accustomed, that every year smartphones, photo and video capabilities are more advanced, and the quality of shooting is improved with the release of the new top model of a manufacturer. At the same time it seems that the main carriers of these features are hopelessly behind and too quickly become obsolete, as opposed to smart phones. Japanese developers of Panasonic, realizing this trend, released camera Lumix DMC-CM10,on its the communication and functionality reaches almost to the rank of a smartphone. The device is a “successor” model Lumix DMC-CM1, released 2 years ago.

					The American company Smart Ltd. Mirror offers SELFIE Mirror, which will do the photo or video, and with the help of Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.0 sends the resulting materials on a smartphone. 16-megapixel camera from Sony is mounted on top of the product. Determining the distance to the subject and focus on the subject  carried out automatically. However, the developers propose to use SELFIE Mirror not only,as the entertainer Toy for the selfe, but also as a means of monitoring in  the flat – built-in camera is in tandem with the motion sensor, so in the event of penetration into the house of strangers, immediately transmit the image on the mobile device of owner. But that is not all. A nice addition would be: LED lighting, speakers for music playback and two USB ports for charging gadgets. In addition, the company’s software enables you to control other devices within the system of smart home,and built-in on surface of mirror the touch screen will display important information such as the weather forecast, the date, time and news from social networks. Developers offer two versions of the smart mirror. SELFIE Mirror with dimensions 550h935 mm model dimensions 70h120 see.

				<p class="para-3">
					While the speed of the 4G LTE networks available to U.S. consumers leave a lot to be desired, industry groups and wireless carriers are already eyeing the transition to 5G technology, which will likely be defined in 2018, codified in 2019, and deployed in 2020. While the standards for the technology are still years away from being set, it’s safe to say that 5G will be faster and less energy-intensive than 4G, which will bring faster smartphones, better smart home devices, and longer-lasting wearables. 5G smartphones will likely experience much lower latency than what we’re used to with 4G, which would mean faster-loading apps and websites, plus lightning-speed downloads of videos. As Jessi Hempel reports for Wired, we’ll need 5G networks both to make virtual reality useful in professional settings and to enable the sensors embedded in everything from watches to cars to work together seamlessly with low latency.

				<p class="para-3">
					We’ve almost got used to the idea of driverless cars before we’ve even seen one on the roads. The truth is, you might well see a lot more driverless trucks – after all, logistics make the world go round. They’ll be cheaper to run than regular rigs, driving more smoothly and so using less fuel. Computers never get tired or need comfort breaks, so they’ll run longer routes. And they could drive in convoys, nose-to-tail, to minimise wind resistance. Companies like Mercedes and Peloton are already exploring these possibilities, and if the promised gains materialise, freight companies could upgrade entire fleets overnight. On the downside, it could put drivers instantly out of work, and even staff at the truck stops set up to service them, but many companies have said the trucks will still need a human passenger to ensure their cargo is safe.

					The device consists of a flat surface upon which the user may "draw" or trace an image using the attached stylus, a pen-like drawing apparatus. The image is displayed on the computer monitor, though some graphics tablets now also incorporate an LCD screen for a more realistic or natural experience and usability.
					Some tablets are intended as a replacement for the computer mouse as the primary pointing and navigation device for desktop computers.
					Forget the iPad Pro! Meet the CROSS2DESIGN Smart Table! Just as it sounds, this interesting marriage of two unlike objects is a hybrid table and tablet in one.
					Of course, the design can be used as a surface for working… but it can also be used to watch entertainment, surf the web, organize ideas, collaboration, educate kids, or even for gaming! Touch-sensitive, it’s easy to access programs and organize the interactive desktop. Inspired by robotic legs, it also transitions between horizontal and vertical with the touch of a button for presentations, movies and more!

				<p class="para-3">
					A virtual reality headset provides immersive virtual reality for the wearer. VR headsets are widely used with computer games but they are also used in other applications, including simulators and trainers. They comprise a stereoscopic head-mounted display (providing separate images for each eye), stereo sound, and head motion tracking sensors[1] (which may include gyroscopes, accelerometers, structured light systems,[2] etc.). Some VR headsets also have eye tracking sensors[3] and gaming controllers.
					Like VR headsets, augmented reality headsets are expected to become an interesting part of our gadget arsenal within the next few years. As Scott Stein reported for CNET upon the unveiling of Microsoft’s HoloLens, the word “holographic” was tossed around during the event. While some researchers think that holographic TVs may become a reality by 2020 or shortly thereafter, it’s looking like augmented reality — which doesn’t offer a true version of holograms — will be the technology that paves the way for shows and games that project characters and environments onto your living room and create immersive virtual worlds that blend with your surroundings. Noted futurist Ray Kurzweil has even predicted that in the not-so-distant future, we’ll be in augmented reality at all times.

				<p class="para-3">
					The company Corning has announced a new generation of their “unbreakable” glass – Gorilla Glass 5. It is more durable glass screens to protect mobile devices from damage. Obviously, it is Gorilla Glass 5 will be used in the new smartphone iPhone 7, which is expected in September. Such similar protective glass used in the Apple models since their introduction in the market. However, the problem with broken displays of the iPhone were: users periodically dropped phones and damage did not save even a glass Gorilla Glass.
					With the new Gorilla Glass 5 likelihood of this decline significantly. According to the company, the new glass designed specifically to not break, even when the smartphone falls on a hard surface. So, in laboratory tests Gorilla Glass 5 are not broken in 80% of cases in the fall from a height of 1.6 m on a hard floor. This, the company says, is far superior to competitors’ results. New glass is expected to be used in the finished product by the end of this year, which means the iPhone 7 has all the chances to get it.
